			<h2>Vision</h2>
			<p>I make improvements to the world around me every day.</p>

			<p>I feel happy, relaxed and organized.</p>

			<p>I have great relationships with Jordan, Luc and Rowan.</p>

			<p>We get to see our families often.</p>

			<p>I have strong relationships with my parents, my brother, my extended family, and Jordan's family.</p>

			<p>We have great friendships and get to spend lots of time with our friends.</p>

			<p>We live in our beautiful house on Winston Road. It's been set up just the way we like it, inside and out.</p>

			<p>Every day, we plant seeds for financial independence.</p>

			<p>I use my skills as a product manager to help grow CF Global's revenue.</p>

			<p>I make fair proposals. I am classy and confident in my dealings with people.</p>

			<p>I am transitioning Squash Source to a business model where squash enthusiasts want to send me money directly.</p>

			<p>I spend wisely to grow my income, following the 80/20 rule.</p>

			<p>I work mostly from home and love it.</p>

			<p>We send Luc and Rowan to the schools and camps that are best for them and us.</p>

			<p>We travel to interesting and beautiful places in the world.</p>

			<p>I play squash regularly and feel fit and healthy.</p>

			<p>I'm proud to compete at a high level in squash tournaments.</p>

			<p>I trust my vision will become reality.</p>
